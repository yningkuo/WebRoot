                <h4><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/geolocation-sensor/" id="linkColor">W3C Geolocation-sensor Overview</a></h4>
                W3C has a clear definition about how Geolocation Sensor Interface obtain the geolocation of the hosting device. 
                Also provided with several useful code examples to introduce how to code for Geolocation Sensors.
                <br>
                The Geolocation Sensor can both operate in the foreground and background. 
                <b>In the foreground operation</b>, it can get a one-off geolocation update. Take Google maps for example, it just like you type in a location and search.
                It can also do continuous geolocation updates. Like using Google Maps for navigating to your destination while driving. 
                <b>For the foreground operation</b>, it can get a one-off geolocation update like using on Ride share application or Retail special offers. 
                It can also do continuous geolocation updates, such as tracking sports activity. 
                <br> 
                With these powerful feactures, I think it's very good to apply Geolocation Sensor on the app for tracking the user's location and show the related advertisements.

                Code labs provide with a detail information about how to get sensor data via a mobile app. This is very useful for building an app which utilizes sensors.
                <br>
                However, the device camera, fingerprint sensor, microphone, and GPS (location) sensor all have their own APIs and are not considered part of the Android sensor framework. Therefore, they will not be included in this page.

                <h4><a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/sensors/sensors_overview" id="linkColor">Android Developers - Sensor</a></h4>

                In this article, Android Developers provides with very detailed introduction to all of the sensors in the Android sensor framework.
                It talks about how to identify sensors capbilities and how to monitor sensors events. 
                It also shares the knowledge about how to test with Android Emulator, which has an awesome interface and easy to use.
                <br>
                I think this article includes everything you need to learn about sensors. I will try the Android Emulator for app development.
